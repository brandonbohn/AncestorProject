This project is a final capstone project that utilizes Frontend frameworks such as React.js and Bootstrap to make calls using Axios to A my Sql Database.  By doing this it allows a list of ancestors to be displayed and creates a new webapage with information about each ancestor.  This is a first version and subsquent versions will allow for photos of the ancestors to be saved on thier page. Further, this will allow for Artifiacts or past pieces of history about the ancestors such as vital records to be stored with the ancestor.
